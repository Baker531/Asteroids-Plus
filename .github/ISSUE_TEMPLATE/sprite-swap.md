**Sprite replaced**
What sprite are you suggesting an alternative to?
e.g. enemy, ship, enemy-brute, bullet

**Reason**
What don't you like about the old sprite, and why is the new one better?

**New sprite**
What new sprite are you suggesting? Don't leave this empty. Provide either a PNG image, a folder of PNG frames, or a GameMaker sprite folder. If you're providing a number of frames that is different to the previous number of frames, should we
- (A) speed up framerate
- (B) play animation for longer
- (C) use frames for behaviour (describe behaviour)

**[Note]**
If your sprite is good but didn't quite make the cut, it may go into a media library in the future. Who knows? I know it's hard making a sprite and having it ditched, so I'll try to keep it in case I do create such a feature.
